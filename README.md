# Atelier Ryza: Password Finder GraphQL API

GraphQL API for Atelier Ryza: Password Finder.

This is based on and a stripped down version of [GraphQL Starter boilerplate](https://github.com/cerino-ligutom/GraphQL-Starter).

## Getting Started

Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

Run directly on your machine
```bash
npm start
```

### OR

Run with Docker
```bash
# Build the project for the first time or when you add dependencies
docker-compose build

# Start the application (or to restart after making changes to the source code)
docker-compose up
```

**Note:** You might be prompted to share your drive with Docker if you haven't done so previously. The drive letter you need to share in this case would be the drive letter of where this repository resides.
